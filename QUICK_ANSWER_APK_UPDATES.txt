❌ NO - APK DOES NOT AUTO-UPDATE
=================================

SIMPLE ANSWER:
--------------
The APK you built earlier does NOT include your new changes.
You need to build a NEW APK and share it again.

WHY?
----
- APK = Snapshot of your code at build time
- Code changes = Need new APK
- Old APK = Old code (no new features)

WHAT TO DO NOW:
---------------

OPTION 1: Quick Manual Update (5 minutes)
1. flutter build apk --release
2. Upload new APK to Google Drive
3. Share new link with users
4. Users download and install manually

OPTION 2: Setup Auto-Update System (10 minutes)
1. Run: flutter pub get
2. I've created AppUpdateService for you
3. App will check for updates automatically
4. Shows "Update Available" dialog
5. Users click "Update Now" to download

WHICH OPTION?
-------------

Choose OPTION 1 if:
- You want to release update RIGHT NOW
- Simple and fast
- Users manually download

Choose OPTION 2 if:
- You want professional update system
- Users get notified automatically
- Better user experience
- Takes a bit more setup

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
✅ Auto-update service created (app_update_service.dart)
✅ version.json template created
✅ Complete guide written (APK_UPDATE_GUIDE.md)
⚠️ Need to run: flutter pub get
⚠️ Need to integrate into main.dart
⚠️ Need to build new APK

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
Tell me which option you want:
1. "Build new APK now" - I'll help you build and share
2. "Setup auto-update" - I'll integrate the update system first

YOUR CHOICE?
