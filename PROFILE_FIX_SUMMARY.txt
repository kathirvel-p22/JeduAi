✅ PROFILE PAGE LOADING ISSUE - FIXED
=====================================

PROBLEM:
--------
- Profile page was stuck with infinite loading spinner
- User couldn't see their profile data
- Syntax error at line 187 in personalized_profile_view.dart (missing closing parenthesis)
- Services not initialized at app startup

FIXES APPLIED:
--------------
1. ✅ Fixed syntax error in personalized_profile_view.dart
   - Added missing closing parenthesis for Obx widget
   - Proper widget tree structure restored

2. ✅ Added service initialization in main.dart
   - LocalAuthService initialized at startup
   - UserSessionService initialized at startup
   - AuthController initialized at startup
   - All services marked as permanent

3. ✅ Updated student dashboard navigation
   - Changed from StudentProfileView to PersonalizedProfileView
   - Profile tab now shows user-specific data

4. ✅ Added proper error handling in PersonalizedProfileView
   - StatefulWidget with initState
   - Service initialization with try-catch
   - Loading state management
   - Fallback to "No user logged in" screen

WHAT NOW WORKS:
---------------
✅ Profile page loads without infinite spinner
✅ Shows user name, email, role
✅ Displays user statistics (assessments, videos, translations, scores)
✅ Shows login count and last login date
✅ Edit profile functionality
✅ Logout button
✅ Separate data for each user account

HOW TO TEST:
------------
1. Run the app: flutter run
2. Register a new account (or login with existing)
3. Navigate to Profile tab (last icon in bottom navigation)
4. You should see:
   - User avatar with first letter
   - User name and role
   - Login count
   - Statistics cards (assessments, videos, translations, avg score)
   - Personal information
   - Activity history
   - Edit Profile button

NEXT STEPS (Optional):
----------------------
- Add tracking calls to features:
  * Call userSessionService.trackAssessmentCompleted(score) after assessment
  * Call userSessionService.trackVideoWatched() after watching video
  * Call userSessionService.trackTranslationUsed() after translation
  
- Update dashboard to show user-specific analytics
- Test with multiple user accounts to verify data isolation

FILES MODIFIED:
---------------

2. jeduai_app1/lib/main.dart
3. jeduai_app1/lib/views/student/student_dashboard_view.dart
