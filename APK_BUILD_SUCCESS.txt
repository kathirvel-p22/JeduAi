Once you complete the steps above, your app will:
1. Be available for download from Google Drive
2. Automatically notify users when updates are available
3. Show "Update Available" dialog with version info
4. Allow one-click updates through the app

Users with v1.0.0 will automatically see the update notification
when they open the app (after you push version.json to GitHub).

Great work! 🚀
