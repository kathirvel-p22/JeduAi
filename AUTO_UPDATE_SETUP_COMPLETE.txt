✅ AUTO-UPDATE SYSTEM - SETUP COMPLETE!
========================================

WHAT WAS DONE:
--------------
✅ Installed package_info_plus dependency
✅ Created AppUpdateService (app_update_service.dart)
✅ Integrated into main.dart
✅ Added "Check for Updates" button to profile
✅ Configured GitHub URL for version checking
✅ Created version.json template
✅ App checks for updates 2 seconds after startup

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. App starts → Waits 2 seconds
2. Checks: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kathirvel-p22/JeduAi/main/version.json
3. Compares current version (1.0.0) with server version
4. If newer version available → Shows "Update Available" dialog
5. User clicks "Update Now" → Opens Google Drive download link
6. User downloads and installs new APK

NEXT STEPS TO RELEASE UPDATE:
------------------------------

STEP 1: Update Version Number
Edit pubspec.yaml:
```
version: 1.0.1+2  # Change from 1.0.0+1
```

STEP 2: Build New APK
```bash
cd jeduai_app1
flutter build apk --release
```

STEP 3: Upload APK to Google Drive
- Upload: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
- Get shareable link
- Copy the link

STEP 4: Update version.json
Edit version.json:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "downloadUrl": "YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK",
  "message": "New features:\n• Personalized profiles\n• User database view\n• Auto-update system\n• Bug fixes",
  "releaseDate": "2024-02-20",
  "mandatory": false
}
```

STEP 5: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Release v1.0.1 with auto-update"
git push origin main
```

STEP 6: Test It!
- Install OLD APK (v1.0.0) on test device
- Open app
- Wait 2-3 seconds
- Should see "Update Available" dialog!
- Click "Update Now"
- Download and install new APK

FEATURES ADDED:
---------------
✅ Automatic update checking on app startup
✅ "Update Available" dialog with version comparison
✅ Manual "Check for Updates" button in profile
✅ Direct download link to Google Drive
✅ Version comparison (1.0.0 vs 1.0.1)
✅ Update message display
✅ Graceful fallback if update check fails

USER EXPERIENCE:
----------------
1. User opens app
2. Sees "Update Available" dialog (if update exists)
3. Shows current version vs latest version
4. Shows what's new in the update
5. Two options: "Later" or "Update Now"
6. Clicking "Update Now" opens download link
7. User downloads and installs
8. Data is preserved!

MANUAL UPDATE CHECK:
--------------------
Users can also manually check:
1. Go to Profile tab
2. Scroll down
3. Click "Check for Updates" button
4. Shows "Checking for updates..." dialog
5. Either shows "Update Available" or "Up to Date"

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
-----------------------
✅ lib/services/app_update_service.dart (NEW)
✅ lib/main.dart (MODIFIED - added update service)
✅ lib/views/student/personalized_profile_view.dart (MODIFIED - added button)
✅ pubspec.yaml (MODIFIED - added package_info_plus)
✅ version.json (NEW - version info file)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
⚠️ version.json MUST be in GitHub root (not in jeduai_app1 folder)
⚠️ Move version.json to repository root before pushing
⚠️ Update version.json EVERY TIME you release new APK
⚠️ Google Drive link must be publicly accessible
⚠️ Version format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.1)
